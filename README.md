# Outreachy-Internship-Contribution-1
This is my first contribution to the Wikimedia project on translation imbalances.

Mark Graham, Ralph K. Straumann and Bernie Hogan co-authored the paper following the research on Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism: Mapping participation in Wikipedia. It was received/accepted and published on the 1st June 2015 and 4th September 2015 respectively.

The paper addresses the mismatch between the expected amount of communication and public participation on the world's largest and most used repository - Wikipedia. This is a platform where we are enabled to gain important insights into the geographies of voice and participation. . However, expectations are not in line with the actual patterns of participation on the online knowledge platform.

Resources:

Data was collected from 120 countries where 500 most visited websites were derived.
The IP addresses of the various gadgets of the "active Wikipedians" were provided through a Geolite Legacy Database- Maxmind.
The Wikipedia editor dump from the 7th of October, 2011 also served as a source of data.
The following world regions were included in the analysis; Asia and Europe (EUR), North America (NOAM), Latin America and the Caribbean (LACA), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), Oceania (OCEA), and sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
Patterns, hypotheses and informed guesses:

There is a "theoretical" democratization of the internet as opposed to the true state of the voices and participation recorded. Not all voices, that is, people across all countries and tongues has their democratic participation demonstrated.
(Referenced from the article- The connections afforded to all of those people, in theory, allow for an unprecedented amount of communication and public participation).

There is a highly uneven geographies of participation as a result of the participation from the world's peripheries focusing on editing about the world's cores rather than creating contents peculiar to their local regions. Hence, the relationship between the availability of broadband internet connections and the propensity of people participation on Wikipedia not being linear in reference to the regression analysis.
(Referenced from the article- Despite the fact that it is widely used around the world, Wikipedia is characterized by highly uneven geographies of participation)
There is a danger of Wikipedia losing the world vision and becoming obsolete if there isn't an increase in the creation of content rather than just consuming the already created contents on the online platform.

There is another factors contributing to the uneven public participation such as vicious and virtuous cycles, this can hypothetically be seen as the resultant effects of world peripheries focusing on world's cores, thereby leading to the "informational magnetism". This makes reconfiguring networks and hierarchies of knowledge production difficult.
(Referenced from the article- Complicating this issue is the fact that participation from the world's economic peripheries tends to focus on editing about the world's cores rather than their own local regions. These results ultimately point to an informational magnetism that is cast by the world's economic cores, virtuous and vicious cycles that make it difficult to reconfigure networks and hierarchies of knowledge production.)

There is a concern raised regarding the poor level of women participation in Wikipedia contributions. One third of the population of users are women, however, only 13% of the fraction are women. An increase in the fraction of women that participate would bring about some changes in the overall scenario.
( Referenced from the article- Women make up approximately one third of users but less than 13 percent of contributors.)

Last but not the least, It is discovered that there is a lower correlation between the number of registered editors per country and the number of edits by those registered editors.
(Referenced from the article- Because the biggest uncertainties are attached to the number of registered editors per country and, by proxy, edits by registered editors, the lower correlations between these variables and the official Wikimedia edits data are not surprising.)
The lower participation of registered editors in the various countries registered is a huge contributor to the Digital Divisions of Labor and Informational Magnetism.

In conclusion, this paper reveals patterns and factors that play a major role in the skewed public participation in contributing to Wikipedia, ranging from lack of accountability, transparency to inclusion.
